# Discrete-D.S.-Project
This is my research project for my Discrete Dynamical Systems course. 

The focus of this research project was to replicate the Encryption and Decryption algorithm outlined in this paper: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0375960198000863
It accomplishes this by encrypting the message with the chaotic *but deterministic* behavior of the Logistic equation. My version of this algorithm 
takes in any message from the user and outputs the decrypted version which can be used as the input for the Decrypter. I also replicated their Histogram plot with a random piece of writing.
